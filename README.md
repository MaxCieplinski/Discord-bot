# Getting or updating the code
Fell free to fetch the code for test/learn purpouses. You can do it with either opening terminal and typing `git clone https://github.com/MaxCieplinski/Discord-bot.git` or pressing the clone button on the main project page. Running or distributing the bot it is not well seen.

# Libraries
All the libraries needed to run the bot are listed below
```
- discord 
```
Other libraries should be built-in.

# How to use
The bot is run by running the `main.py` file which loads all the commands as cogs from the `commands` folder and has some mini-logic for the temporary ban or mute command. Bot uses `json` library for saving all the data (data was deleted before posting in `data.json`).
